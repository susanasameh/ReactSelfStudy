state: الداتا اللى عايشة جوة ال component
props : الحاجات اللى بتجيلي من بره as input


The Component Lifecycle
Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. You can use this lifecycle diagram as a cheat sheet. In the list below, commonly used lifecycle methods are marked as bold. The rest of them exist for relatively rare use cases.

1-Mounting
These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:

constructor()
static getDerivedStateFromProps()
render()
componentDidMount()

2-Updating
An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:

static getDerivedStateFromProps()
shouldComponentUpdate()
render()
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
componentDidUpdate()

3- Unmounting
This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:

componentWillUnmount()

#Error Handling
These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

static getDerivedStateFromError()
componentDidCatch()

لما اجى اكتب ال state

#in React form we use e.preventDefault() to prevent the default behavior of the component from being rendered
